NANO - MACHINE LEARNING
======================================================================


In this project we try to improve the current techniques of imple-
mentation of Machine Learning algorithms in IoT(Internet of Things) devices,
particularly we look at the formulation of k-NN based implementations. We study
Proto-NN, a novel k-NN based algorithm for making predictions on resource
scarce devices, and make improvements on it. Our major contribution is in min-
imizing(or entirely eliminating) the need for sending training points to a central
server(probably a high-end super computer). We successfully investigate into two
techniques, namely, (a) Online Proto-NN (b) Ballogorithm. In Online Proto-NN,
we completely eliminate the need for sending any data to a server by making the
training algorithm completely online. Ballogorithm explores the possibility of
sending intelligently picked limited data to the server instead of sending the entire
dataset.
